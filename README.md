#  Vendbridge : App Performance & User Engagement Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the market performance and technical health of VendBridge, a digital marketplace app, three months post-launch. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard to monitor user adoption, engagement, and stability to inform product strategy.

🎯 # Business Problem

After significant investment in marketing, NexaLink needed to answer:

How effectively is the app converting installs into active, registered users? 

Where are the regional and device-specific bottlenecks in transaction volume? 

Is the app technically stable (crashes) and retaining users? 

📈 # Key Metrics Defined

Adoption: Total App Installs, User Sign-ups, and Sign-up Rate.

Engagement: Daily Active Users (DAU) and Average Time Spent per User.

Retention & Health: Uninstall Volume and Average App Crashes.

Monetization/Utility: Total Transaction Volume.

📈 # Key Insights

Acquisition Gap: Total installs reached 1.98M (+9.0%), but the Sign-up Rate dropped by 38.8%, indicating a bottleneck in the registration funnel.


Stability Issues: App Crashes surged by 24.4% compared to the previous month.


High Engagement: Users spend an average of 100 minutes on the app.


Platform Performance: Android is the leading platform for transactions with 271,639, compared to 199,456 on iOS.


Regional Leaders: The US dominates transaction volume, significantly outperforming EMEA, Canada, APAC, and LATAM.


🛠️ # Tech Stack & Skills

Tools: Tableau Desktop Public Edition.


Techniques: Product Analytics, Dashboard Design, Parameter Actions, and Global Filtering.

💡 # Recommendations

Funnel Optimization: Simplify the sign-up process (e.g., social login) to convert high install volume into active registered users.

Technical Sprint: Prioritize fixing app crashes to ensure long-term user retention.

Market Expansion: Localize successful US marketing and feature tactics for underperforming regions like APAC and LATAM.

Device Focus: Ensure high performance on Android to protect the primary transaction stream while investigating growth opportunities for iOS.
